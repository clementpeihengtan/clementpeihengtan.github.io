                                        <p>Designing thing is one of my interest, I was taught using photoshop by my senior, because at that time, I was choosen as the publicity officer of AUP Club. I usually design things through drawing on plain paper. But when I learn photoshop, I found it really fun especially when you are boring, I will edit some photo. I was first taught to deisgn an invitation card. Slowly I started to learn the extra feature in photoshop. I started to design poster, banner and T-shirt for my club. When I first design our club T-shirt, it received a lots of compliment from my board member as well as the student in my college. That T-shirt design also successfully being chosen by INTI International University Mrketing Team as AUP program official T-shirt. </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Leader of a group of three member</li>
                                        <li>Design and improvised the program of the robot</li>
                                        <li>Guided junior members in learning LEGO Mindstorm Programming</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <p>It was the first time I was exposed to programming. My brother who was one of the former robotic team member influenced me in doing programming. Looking at him doing programming the robot makes me feel excited. Looing at the robot work as what it was program made me very satisfy. I was the head of the my team as well as the programmer. I participated in some training with my teacher and i started to join competition. The first time, we lost, because we lack of experience and we have some battery issue. The next time, we joined again and we took the lesson. We start to improve and finally in the following year, we managed to get 3rd price in out state. As the leader of the team, I make sure every one did their part. we discuss about the design as well as the program. When my teammates were building the robot, I will look at what they did, and try to think whether there is any problem wth the design or not.But most probably, we will test our robot, before we make any changes. It was fun and time consuming, but when I saw my robot made progress day by day, I was have a strong sense of accomplishment.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Head of Construction Team</strong>
                                    <br /><bold>AUP Club Halloween Night, INTI International University</bold></p> 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Construct things according to the instruction of program master</li>
                                        <li>Leading a group of 10 people to construct the props and design the venue</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>This an anual event and one of the biggest event in my previous college. It requires a huge team of people to orgnize this event. I was elected as the head of constrcution. I recruited 10 members to help out in this event. I discuss with my group mate about the detail I got in head of department meeting. We discussed on ways in completing the task given. It is really challenging as we have anly 1 months to prepare everything. I made a schedule to distribute the job among us and give everyone a deadline, because I know that we need time to modify and update other thing. It was really fun and interesting, especially during the day of the event. Before the event start, i assigned each of my group member to different area and I will be constantly walking around the venue to check whether is there any problem with the props and the obstacle in the venue. If there is any problem that they can't fix, they will contact me. We will use a limited time to solve the problem. We work from 8pm to 3pm. Although it was tiring, it was fun and good experience. </p>
